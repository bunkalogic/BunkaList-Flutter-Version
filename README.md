# **_BunkaList_**
Bunkalist is a project to save what you have seen or are watching either movies, series or anime in an orderly manner and the one that scores or values each work in a more realistic way.

This has been my personal project in recent months with which I learned what it is to develop a real app. In which I learned to create design style, to use software design pattern (TDD), the process of optimizing the file of a mobile application in an application store (ASO), multilanguage support.
